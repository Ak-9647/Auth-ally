# Author-Ally Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Author-Ally application to various environments. Author-Ally is a React-based web application that can be deployed as a static site to any web hosting service.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)
- Access to a web hosting service or server
- Git (optional, for version control)

## Building the Application

To create a production-ready build of the application:

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/author-ally/client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This will generate a `build` directory containing optimized static files ready for deployment.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting Services

#### Netlify

1. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. From the Netlify dashboard, click "New site from Git" or drag and drop your `build` folder
3. If using Git integration:
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Set build command to `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory to `build`
4. Click "Deploy site"

#### Vercel

1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
3. Navigate to the project root and run:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to deploy

#### GitHub Pages

1. Add `homepage` to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/author-ally"
   ```
2. Install GitHub Pages package:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```
3. Add deployment scripts to `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Option 2: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Build the application as described above
2. Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your web hosting service using FTP or their provided upload tool
3. Ensure the server is configured to serve the `index.html` file for all routes

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:16-alpine as build
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY client/package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY client/ ./
   RUN npm run build

   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
   COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
   EXPOSE 80
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```

2. Create an `nginx.conf` file:
   ```
   server {
     listen 80;
     server_name _;
     
     location / {
       root /usr/share/nginx/html;
       index index.html;
       try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t author-ally .
   ```

4. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 author-ally
   ```

## Environment Configuration

Author-Ally uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
REACT_APP_AI_SERVICE_KEY=your-ai-service-key
```

For production, set these environment variables on your hosting platform.

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, verify that:

1. The application loads correctly
2. All features work as expected
3. The application is responsive on different devices
4. Auto-save functionality works properly
5. AI features are functioning correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Blank Page After Deployment**
- Ensure the `homepage` field in `package.json` is set correctly
- Check if the server is configured to handle client-side routing
- Verify that all assets are being loaded correctly (check browser console)

**API Connection Issues**
- Confirm that environment variables are set correctly
- Check CORS configuration if using a separate backend
- Verify API endpoints are accessible from the deployed environment

**Performance Issues**
- Enable gzip compression on your server
- Implement a CDN for static assets
- Check for unnecessary re-renders in the React components

## Maintenance

### Updates and Patches

To update the deployed application:

1. Make changes to the codebase
2. Test thoroughly
3. Create a new production build
4. Deploy using the same method as the initial deployment

### Monitoring

Consider implementing:

- Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Analytics (e.g., Google Analytics)
- Performance monitoring (e.g., Lighthouse)

## Scaling Considerations

As your user base grows, consider:

- Implementing a CDN for global distribution
- Setting up a caching strategy
- Optimizing image and asset delivery
- Implementing server-side rendering for improved performance

## Backup Strategy

Regularly backup:

- Source code (using Git or another version control system)
- User data (if stored on a server)
- Configuration files
- Environment variables

## Security Considerations

- Enable HTTPS for all traffic
- Implement proper authentication if adding user accounts
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Set appropriate Content Security Policy headers
